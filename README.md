# Feature Extraction from Image using Deep Learning
**Feature extraction from Images by various Deep Learning AI models**

**I used VGG-16, ResNet, and ZFNet to extract different features from images and find the distance between different features. Moreover, I train VGG-16 with a sample image dataset.**

As the project size is large, here is the drive link to the project
